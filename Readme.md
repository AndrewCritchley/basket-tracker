# Basket Tracker

## To do

- Missing async/await
- Needs actual logging
- Codebase is generally a mess

## Known Problems & Things to Work On

- I have no idea how to handle dependencies in the event handlers that are not already included in the consumer (Such as EF - specifically nuget dependencies. for now this reference has just been added to the consumer but this isn't ideal)
